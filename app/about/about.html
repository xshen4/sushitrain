                  <p> I'm a full stack software engineer currently residing in Oakland, CA and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013. </p>
                  <p> After working at OpenX, an ad tech start up, as a senior full stack software engineer for 3 years I decided to apply what knowledge I have to building products in the health care space.</p>
                  <p> I currently work as a software engineer at Practice Fusion in San Francisco, CA, which offers a cloud based electronic health record platform for doctors and patients.</p>
                  <p> I also volunteer with the non-profit <a href="http://wogrammer.org" target="_blank">Wogrammer</a> as the site's webmaster.  Wogrammer helps break female engineering stereotypes by telling meaningful stories about inspiring women who help impact the tech industry.</p>
                  <p> In my free time, I like to 3D print and learn 3D modeling, participate in community based hackathons, practice the piano and violin to keep my musical interests alive and end the day with a game of Overwatch. </p>

                  <p> I am currently open to opportunities for freelancing development. Please contact me at my <a> xiuli.j.shen@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to start a professional conversation!</p>
